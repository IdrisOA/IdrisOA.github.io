Hi, welcome to my website!

I am a PHD student in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Washington advised by Noah A. Smith and Yulia Tsvetkov. Previously I was a Research Engineer at Instadeep working on AI solutions for enterprise clients. My research interests include topics in Multilingual NLP, Model Efficiency, and Model Interpretability. In particular, my work focuses on designing methods to 1.) develop resource-efficient multilingual models. 2.) leverage model interpretability to improve model performance and demote spurious training data artefacts.
